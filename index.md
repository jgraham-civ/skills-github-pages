title: All The Common Ground
---

Our structures of education like to divide human knowledge into distinct fields. Often, these fields are further subdivided; philosophy within the humanities, ethics within philosophy. The same applies to professional disciplines; consider a doctor specialising in surgery, or a mechanic specialising in aircraft.

These distinctions exist for good reason—I wouldn’t ask J. Robert Oppenheimer to extract my appendix, nor would I ask a surgeon to explain to me the finer points of theoretical physics. 

But to assume neither has anything to offer to the other’s field of expertise is counterproductive. 

While disciplines are rarely kept totally separate, we are invited to specialise more and more as we move through school, higher education and the workforce. 

By highlighting all the common ground shared by subject areas in research and current affairs, I hope to show that tackling global issues means embracing interdisciplinarity.
