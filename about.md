At the risk of undermining everything you’ve just read on my homepage; I should declare that I have my own specialist areas. My background is in biology and medicine, and I have particular interest in infectious diseases, data science and genetics. That is why the name of this blog abbreviates to ATCG – the four compounds which make up DNA. 

Most of my blog posts will talk about developments in these subject areas, but I want to show to readers that bridging the gap between science and the humanities is crucial if we are to overcome issues in public health, the environment and global development. Science cannot work without the input of the humanities, and vice versa.
